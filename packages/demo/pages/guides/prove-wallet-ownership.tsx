        <p>
          It's cryptographically easy to prove the ownership of an account by
          signing a piece of data using a private key. Since a user's public
          address can be used as their identifier, we can build an authentication
          mechanism that is based on message signing. This mechanism is made
          possible because we are able to cryptographically prove the ownership of an
          account by signing a specific piece of data using the corresponding
          private key. If the data is correctly signed, then the backend will
          recognize it as coming from the owner of the public address.
        </p>

        <p>
          JSON Web Token (JWT) claims can typically be used to pass identity of
          authenticated users between an identity provider and a service
          provider. A server (service provider) could generate a token and
          provide that to a client (identity provider). For example, a client could then
          use that token to prove ownership of a wallet, as these tokens can
          be signed by one party's private key (in this case, the client's).
        </p>

        <p>Some example uses of data signing to cryptographically prove ownership:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Authenticate user sign in using JSON Web Token (JWT)</b>. A
            cryptographically-secure login to prove the ownership of an account
            by signing a piece of data using a private key.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Authenticate user's action</b>. If the backend wants to confirm
            a user's authorization on an off-chain action, for example, engaging in
            in-game trading.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Off chain account flow</b>. If you need to display certain data
            that is off-chain or on a website only to a particular user
            identified by their wallet, you could use message signing as a means of
            doing so.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            By signing a message, you are affirming that you are in control of
            the wallet address linked to the Blockchain, and thus can prove
            ownership of it.
          </p>

          <p>There are 4 ingredients to signing a message:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>user wallet address</li>
            <li>private key</li>
            <li>public key</li>
            <li>message to sign</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            To check if a user owns a certain address on a Web3 site, one needs
            to provide a message and have the user "sign" it. This "signature"
            is generated using the message, the user's private key, the public
            key, and a cryptographic algorithm.
          </p>

          <p>
            To ensure the signature is valid, the same cryptographic algorithm
            is applied to the message and the public key is obtained. You may be
            wondering how this can be secure?  The answer is that without the
            private key, the validation of the message and the public key cannot
            be cryptographically matched, thereby confirming ownership.

          <h2>Client: Connect Wallet and Get Staking Address</h2>
          <p>
            The User model stored in the database of the backend server must
            have two compulsory fields: public address and nonce. Furthermore,
            this address has to be unique. Other details about the user, such as
            username, Twitter ID, and name fields can be added, but are not essential 
            for this process.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Cardano, to obtain a user's public address as an identifier, we can use their
            wallet's staking address. This will be stored in the server side
            database, so that authorized wallets can be linked. The user never
            has to worry about manually entering their address, since it can be
            retrieved using <code>wallet.getRewardAddresses()</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the user's wallet connected, the first step is to get the user's staking address and
            send it to our backend server.
          </p>

          <h2>Server: Generate Nonce and Store in Database</h2>

          <p>
            In the backend, we first need to generate a new nonce, which is initialized as a
            random string. The purpose of this is to create a unique message
            that can be used for authentication of the user's wallet. This nonce
            will be the payload for the user to prove ownership of the wallet. With
            Mesh, you can generate a new nonce with <code>generateNonce()</code>
            , and set the message as{' '}
            <code>Sign to login in to Mesh: nonce</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            By utilizing the <code>userAddress</code>, we can look up the
            database to determine whether the user is new or already exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the user is new, we can create a new user entry, storing their
            staking address, nonce, and set their status as "not verified". Once
            the user has successfully verified, we can update their status to
            "verified" in our database.
          </p>
          <p>
            For existing users, we just have to store the newly generated nonce
            in the database.
          </p>

          <Codeblock data={codeSnippet2} isJson={false} />

          <p>
            Lastly, we will return the <code>nonce</code> for the user to sign
            using their private key.

          <h2>Server: Verify Signature</h2>

          <p>
            When the backend receives the request, it retrieves the user associated
            with the specified address from the database. It then obtains the
            associated nonce from the database,
            which is a random value that is only known to the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the nonce, staking address, and signature, the backend can
            cryptographically check that the nonce has been correctly signed by
            the user. This allows the backend to verify that the user is the
            owner of the public address, as only the owner of the address would
            know the nonce value and be able to sign it with the associated
            private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the signature is verified, the user has successfully
            authenticated and the frontend will then receive a JSON Web Token
            (JWT) or session identifier to allow the user to access further
            resources. This is an example is for login process, but you can
            change it to use in approving a specific action, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also ensure that the nonce is not re-used (as this would make it
            possible for an attacker to gain access to the user's account). This
            is done by generating a random nonce for the user and saving it to
            the database. By constantly generating a unique nonce each time the
            user logs in, we can guarantee the user's signature is secure and
            keep their account safe.
